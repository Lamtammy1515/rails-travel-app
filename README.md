# Travel App Readme - Rails Portfolio Project

## Description
This is a CRUD app that allows a user, aka a traveler, to create new cities and trip reviews. For each trip review submitted, the user can assign a rating of 1-5, add a Must See Attraction, and include additional comments to share with other travelers. Travel sites like TripAdvisor were my inspiration, but as this is a school project, my app is a much simpler version! To use the app, a user must create a new account either through Facebook or by providing a unique email address.
